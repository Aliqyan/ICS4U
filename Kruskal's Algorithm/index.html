                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                Joseph Kruskal, an American statistician, mathematician and computer scientist, created this Algorithm in 1956. Kruskal's Algorithm's finds the Minimum Spanning Tree(MST) of a graph, meaning that it finds the smallest total edge weight needed to connect all vertices of the graph. Thus, the total number of edges in a MST will be equal to one less than the number of vertices in the tree. Kruskal’s Algorithm is classified as a greedy Algorithm as it chooses the smallest edge weights to create its MST. The time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm is O(Elog(E)), where E represents the number of edges.

                Pseudo Code
            </h2>
            <pre>KRUSKAL(G):
1  A = ∅
2  foreach v ∈ G.V:
3     MAKE-SET(v)
4  foreach (u, v) in G.E ordered by weight(u, v), increasing:
5     if FIND-SET(u) ≠ FIND-SET(v):
6        A = A ∪ {(u, v)}
7        UNION(u, v)
8  return A</pre>
            <p>
                Although this pseudo code seems complex, it is fairly easy to follow.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Long Explanation:
            </h3>
            <p>
                The above pseudo code initializes an empty set, A which will be the Minimum Spanning Tree. Line 2 and 3 are responsible for creating a set for every vertex (this is a data structure called a <a href="">disjoint set</a>), storing the vertices that are connected to it. Line 4 assumes that the edges are already in increasing order, (this can quickly be done using the Arrays.sort() method in java which utilizes the quick sort algorithm), and then iterates through the edges. Whilst doing so it checks to see whether vertices u and v are in the same set using the Union Find Algorithm, which checks to see is the vertices two sets have a common vertex. If they were that would mean adding the edge would create a cycle in the MST, which is not allowed, so therefore the edge is ignored. Else, the edge (u,v) is added to the set A. the next step is to join the sets of u and v together as they are now connected. Lines 4 to 7 are then repeated until all the edges are connected. The MST is now created, and the pseudo code returns A.

                    Applications
                </h2>
                	<p>Kruskal's algorithm works extremely well in cases where networks have to be formed, as the algorithm can minimize the cost/resources needed. For example Kruskal's algorithm can be used to create an electrical gridline which connects multiple houses and connection points together whilst minimizing the wiring and cost needed.</p>
                	<p>Furthermore, Kruskal's algorithm can be applied to complex 'NP' problems like the traveling salesman problem to approximate solutions. </p>
